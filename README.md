# Quest
Quest is an interactive platform to submit code snippets from students to a teacher in class. It is a web application based on node.js, socket.io and bootstrap.

Install the dependencies through
```
npm install
```
and fire up the server (standard listening on port 3000) with
```
node server.js
```

Then open a browser and go to
```
http://localhost:3000/
```

Enjoy,

Cedric
